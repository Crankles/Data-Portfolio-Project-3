# Python-Portfolio-Project-3
## A Python portfolio project
The aim of this project was to investigate and interpret data that could be found in reality.

The data was divided into two datasets, `species` and `observations`, the prior containing data on species such as scientific name, category and conservation status and the latter containing data such as scientific name, park name and number of observations of said species.

The data was provided by [CodeCademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/) and is inspired by real life data.
